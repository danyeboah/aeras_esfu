#Epidemiology and Site Feasibility Data
This is a web application I built to allow individuals at Aeras to easily
access epidemiology data in a dynamic way.

It has two control interfaces:

1. The first allows one to select specific sites in specific countries and display data based on the selected conditions like age range etc

2. The second allows one to select specific conditons like HIV incidence range and display which specific sites in specific countries meet the selected criteria.

This was mainly built with the Rshiny framework, which a is web application framework for the statistical package, R.
